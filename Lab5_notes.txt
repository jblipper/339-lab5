-2275 = DAC voltage to stabilize at -5 degrees

Band = range of values from setpoint temperature(max/min = band/2), so for example, band of 8 with setpoint = -5 = max is -1 and min is -9

Exercise 3:
- Peltier system has inherent non-linearity(there is a back voltage dependent on temperature differential (deltaV = S*deltaT)) that makes its responses different to linear graphs found in lab lecture(which are adapted to resistors).
- ^ Good for discussion(but need sources)
- The temperature always stays in the band range closest to starting temp(for ex, starting from -15 and going to -10 means temperature will fluctuate around -11 ish instead of lower)
- -10(band 4.8): barely fluctuating(+-0.1degrees), difference of around -B/3 from setpoint
- -10(band 3): barely fluctuating(+-0.15degrees), difference of around -B/3 from setpoint
- -10(band 1): barely fluctuating(+-0.05degrees), difference of around -B/3 from setpoint, stabilizes longer than other bands
- -10(band 8): barely fluctuating(0 degrees), difference of around -B/3 from setpoint, stabilizes faster, completely stable
Band seems to be proportional to stability, 1 is not that stable and takes longer to settle, 8 stabilized completely 

Exercise 4:
- Integral response time was optimized to a range of 30-60s, ALL DATA WAS TAKEN AT 30 SECONDS!!
- When reaching near temperature, proportional control undershoots by ~ 0.5C before stabilizing back up again(something to discuss)

Exercise 6 (Originality):
- Integral time 30 seconds for all trials
- Band width at 4.8 degrees C for all trials
- Control period 200 ms for all trials
- For 45 positive, higher derivative times cause larger osscilations
- For -10 positive, higher derivative times cause large oscillations and temperature does not get to set point (100s and 120s derivative time)
- For negative derivative term, it had a destabilizing effect especially at high derivative times. 
- Lower derivative times were tested for negative derivative term, since the vast majority of the range tested for positive derivative times would never stabilize.
- At derivative time of 8s for 45, the temperature still stabilizes but very slowly and there are still many oscillations (8s seems to be a critical point for stabilization)
- critical point is a bit higher for -10, 10s still stabilizes but 
- similar behavior overall for both temperatures
- negative derivative term seems to stay at maximum output deep into the band compared to the other trials
