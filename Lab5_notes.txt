-2275 = DAC voltage to stabilize at -5 degrees

Band = range of values from setpoint temperature(max/min = band/2), so for example, band of 8 with setpoint = -5 = max is -1 and min is -9

Exercise 3:
- Peltier system has inherent non-linearity(there is a back voltage dependent on temperature differential (deltaV = S*deltaT)) that makes its responses different to linear graphs found in lab lecture(which are adapted to resistors).
- ^ Good for discussion(but need sources)
- The temperature always stays in the band range closest to starting temp(for ex, starting from -15 and going to -10 means temperature will fluctuate around -11 ish instead of lower)
- -10(band 4.8): barely fluctuating(+-0.1degrees), difference of around -B/3 from setpoint
- -10(band 3): barely fluctuating(+-0.15degrees), difference of around -B/3 from setpoint
- -10(band 1): barely fluctuating(+-0.05degrees), difference of around -B/3 from setpoint, stabilizes longer than other bands
- -10(band 8): barely fluctuating(0 degrees), difference of around -B/3 from setpoint, stabilizes faster, completely stable
Band seems to be proportional to stability, 1 is not that stable and takes longer to settle, 8 stabilized completely 

Exercise 4:
- Integral response time was optimized to a range of 30-60s, ALL DATA WAS TAKEN AT 30 SECONDS!!
- When reaching near temperature, proportional control undershoots by ~ 0.5C before stabilizing back up again(something to discuss)

Exercise 6 (Originality):
- Integral time 30 seconds for all trials
- Band width at 4.8 degrees C for all trials
